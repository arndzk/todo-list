### Bugs

- [x] on project deletion, a mysteriously generated click causes a refocus
      on the list item that is the object of the deletion, overriding the default
      behavior - focus on the first item on the list, if one exists - this will either
      cause the project that takes the deleted ones' place on the list to become
      focused or, if the item was the last on one the list, the focusing function
      will return null.
  ## FIX:
  After several attempts at fixing this (incl. making the list unclickable while
  it re-renders, deleting the event listener of the list item being deleted, making the
  listener activate on dblclick), the opt was to refactor the deletion feature, by
  creating a prompt when the project-delete-btn is clicked, to confirm the deletion
  from its controls, instead of proceeding with it right away. This way, the rogue
  click doesn't seem to be generated at all and now the post-deletion project focus
  works as intended.
- [x] 07/01 - on saving a project, the add-project-form doesn't close as intended,
      despite the project being saved successfully. The console prints an Uncaught TypeError
      about an array not being defined.
  ## FIX:
  07/01 - the error's source was a loop that was logging values to the console for me to check.
  After deleting that bit of code, since it wasn't useful anymore, no error appears in the console
  on saving a project.

### Progress Log

#### 07/01

- Finally, built the task addition feature; most of the difficulties were caused by the fact
  that the tasks weren't handled consistently as objects throughout the entire logic and because
  I haven't had figured out how to properly store an array of objects in an object in an array of
  objects in localStorage.
- After solving the above, retrieving and rendering tasks also became possible.

#### 08/01

- Extended the task additon feature by allowing the addition of descriptions, due dates and priority.
  The priority buttons themselves are custom radio buttons.
- All data for each task-list-item are displayed, priority is signified by the color of the task's
  corresponding "check circle".

#### 09/01

- Task list items now have their own edit and delete buttons.
- Tasks can now be edited - task editing form requires further styling.
- Tasks can now be deleted.

#### 10/01

- Tasks can now be marked and unmarked, which changes their isDone value between
  false and true.
